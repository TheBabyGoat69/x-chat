x-chat is a simple chat applications where all registered users can see and chat with each other
it is a final project for the ALX software engineering program as criteria for graduation
x-chat is just a simple app with a beautiful interface to showcase a little summary of what we learned during the program given the short time span/busy schedule we had to round up
few features of the app are:
1. user registration and authentication with firebase
2. uthenticated users can login
3. Authenticated users can see all available members who are also registered
4. users can go ahead to create a chatroom with any user of their choice
5. real time messages
6. time stamp on each message to keep track of when a message was sent
7. users can also send emojis to make chat more fun
8. users can send photos.
Due to the short time, we were faced with some few bugs e.g the fuctionality of sending photos stopped working in production, which we didn't have enough time to fix but we hope to fix such bugs and redeploy
it was created with next.js/react(for the user interface) and firebase for the backend(database,authenticaton etc)
created by Philip Elias and Asak Erhumuose as a team project
